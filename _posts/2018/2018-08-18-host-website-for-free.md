## What is a static site generator?

A static site generator builds a website using plain HTML files. When a user visits a website created by a static site generator, it is loaded no differently than if you had created a website with plain HTML. By contrast, a dynamic site running on a server side language, such as PHP, must be built every time a user visits the site.

You can treat a static site generator as a very simple sort of CMS (content management system). Instead of having to include your entire header and footer on every page, for example, you can create a header.html and footer.html and load them into each page. Instead of having to write in HTML, you can write in Markdown, which is much faster and more efficient.

Here are some of the main advantages of static site generators over dynamic sites:

**Speed** – your website will perform much faster, as the server does not need to parse any content. It only needs to read plain HTML.

**Security** – your website will be much less vulnerable to attacks, since there is nothing that can be exploited server side.

**Simplicity** – there are no databases or programming languages to deal with. A simple knowledge of HTML and CSS is enough.

**Flexibility** – you know exactly how your site works, as you made it from scratch.

With the help of Jekyll or Middleman + Netiley + Github account, you can create small startup business or information sharing or Portfolio sites with nearly no cost.

**Note** : All you have to Hire Website Developer once and Domain Name every year.
